Trie

A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node. Instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string. Tries are commonly used for tasks like autocomplete and spell checking.
